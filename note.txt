Things worth noting:
	Small things that can cause problem with the front-end/db loading scripts

	* Trip duration output is of the form h:m , if m=0 it looks like 3:0. Should ensure formatting on the front-end (or more post processing can be added).
	* Same with price : dollars.cents, if cents = 0, it looks like 44.0. 
	
	* Stop location is not truncated like in the example 
		"McMaster University. The McMaster University stop is located at McMaster University at Mary Keyes and Cootes Drive."
		vs
		"McMaster University at Mary Keyes and Cootes Drive"
		
		This is because their server sends non-uniform data. Can add more post-processing but this is good enough.
		
	* Departure function gets price&info for all possible routes for the range of dates
		Specific function within a nested loop so possible to easily get price&info for one specific route for a range of dates
		
	* Step i+1 needs information from previous i steps (that is not present in the json). Would be faster to pickle (save to file) the info for previous step.. but requires disk space. Easy to do but not included
	
	* Possible to implement multithreads for the http request in step 3, not included.
	
	* Json file can contain unicode codepoints
		"997 St-Antoine Ouest (M\u00e9tro Bonaventure)."
		
	* Python dicts are unordered so the json output is too
